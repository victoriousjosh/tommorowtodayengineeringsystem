            <h3>TTES MISSION STATEMENT:</h3>
            <p>
            To achieve customer satisfaction all the time and concentrate on and dominate its selected
             markets segments through the dedicated pursuit of excellence in all aspects of its activities.  
             TTES endeavors to pursue a long range strategic business plan that directs the goals in order 
             to achieve the future vision of the firm. The plan focuses on the implementation of the
             following four major initiatives: 

                <h2>1.	Quality Enhancement. </h2>
                <p> 
                    Continual improvement of the effectiveness of the quality management system. Maintain
                    our commitment to quality which has earned us a solid reputation for consistently
                    delivering sound and reliable products and services to our clients. 
                </p>

                <h2>2.	Human Resources. </h2>
                <p> 
                  Attract, motivate, train and retain skilled and competent staff. Ensure that TTES
                  is a good place to Work. 
                </p>

                <h2>3.	Geographic Coverage. </h2>
                <p> 
                  In order to meet our vision to be a leader in the electro-mechanical field in the 
                  East Africa and Africa, we should geographically develop and expand additional
                  markets from time to time. 
                </p>

                <h2>4.	Profitability Improvement</h2>
                <p> 
                 Conduct all firm operations and activities in a Cost effective manner 
                </p>
             
           </p>

        <div class="aboutDataContent">
            <h3>MOST IMPORTANTLY</h3>
            <p>
               It is important to remember that these four initiatives are highly interrelated.
               Thus the success of one depends upon the success of the others. The main objective,
               perhaps the most important one, is the process which includes setting goals and
               working to achieve them. This process is the corner stone of our strategic plan 
               and is essential to our success. 
           </p>

        <div class="aboutDataContent">
            <h3>Quality Policy: </h3>
            <p>
            Put simply:<br>  
            We will spare no effort at doing what our Clients and People want us to do, and that is to serve them best.
